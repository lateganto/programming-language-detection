# Image-Based Detection of Programming Languages

Machine learning experiment to classify programming languages based on images rendered from the source code.

See the [Jupyter notebook](ProgrammingLanguageDetection.ipynb) and
[accompanying blog post](https://rivolaks.com/posts/programming-language-detection/) for more info.

The notebook requires Python 3.6 with `fastai==1.0.18`, nightly (pre-1.0 PyTorch), and other packages.
See `requirements.txt` for a full listing.
